# lme-coding-challenge

Please find the code for my martian robots solution :)

I could have spent more time on this however I tried to stick to the three hour brief.

Had I spent more time I would have added unit tests for input parsing and output parsing and made probably have abstracted both out to make differring input and output formats more seamless. For testing I focussed on making sure the domain logic and enclosed logic was tested thoroughly.

I could have added a lot more validation to the app overall, particularly in terms of input validation however in trying to stick to the timeframe in the brief I only added validation for the landscape to highlight I was indeed thinking about this.

I know there are a few abstractions in my solution which may look like overengineering however I wanted the solution to be as loosely coupled and easily extensible in terms of the problem changing, e.g. say a drone with different movement characteristics on Mars or a droid on Jupiter lol!
